# use-less-js

Just experimenting with some things I learned at a codemash session.

Principle: use the least powerful tool to accomplish what you want.

JS > CSS > HTML

https://scroll-driven-animations.style/

Examples included:
* Accordian implemented with `<details>` and `<summary>`
* Datalist (dropdown w/ ability to filter options by typing)
* Carousel implemented with scroll-snap-* CSS styles
* Dialog that only needs one line of JS
